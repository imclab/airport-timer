<div id="about">

<p><strong>Airport Timer</strong> is a simple web-based stopwatch application to
record how long it takes to get through security at the airport.</p>

<div class="image">

</div>

<p>To start you simply enter the 3-letter of the airport you're visiting and the
name (or letter or number) of the terminal you're flying out of. You can also
specify the name of the security checkpoint but that's optional.</p>

<div class="image">

</div>

<p>Then press the <code>start</code> button. Once you're through security press
the <code>stop</code> button.</p>

</div>

<p>You'll then be asked to confirm the time it took to make it through
security.</p>

<p>If you say <q>yes</q> your time will be uploaded anonymously to <a href="https://pachube.com/feeds?q=straup&tag=airport-timer">Pachube</a> and you'll be given the opportunity to tell the Tweeterverse about the
experience.</p>

<p>And yes, it will work on your phone.</p>
